# E_procurement

# Idea
<p>
  This project focuses on to make E-procurement procedure more effective and useful for users and businesses.
  Many time we have seen while shopping on an e-commerce website that a product is not good even it has got 
  good ratings .
  
  But reviews on the product says truth.
  But it is impossible to check thousands of reviews and ratings on a particular product manually.
  But using some data analytics tools and techniques we can automate this process which will be very helpful 
  for users to buy a good product.
  so i have implemented a solution prototype of such problems .
  By using the data of positive reviews and negative reviews on a product we can differentiate that which product 
  is performing well among users and than by calculating a generalized score for every product we can rank products.
  I have used smartphones data available on flipkart using web scrapping.
